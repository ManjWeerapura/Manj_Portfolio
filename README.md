# [PROJECT 1 : Covid-19 Epitope Prediction for in-silico Vaccine Design](https://github.com/ManjWeerapura/python_projects/tree/main/Covid19_epitope_prediction_for_vaccine_development)
Identify possible Covid-19 epitope candidates which can be used as a starting points for vaccine development. Using various related and unrelated peptides with specific features as well as their ability to evoke neutralizing antibody responses, I evaluated Machine Learning models’ ability in predicting the induction of anti- Covid-19 antibodies.  Surprisingly, many of these ‘candidates’ align within a small region of the spike protein of the virus. The spike protein is presumed to bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the host cell membrane. This binding initiates virus internalization and hijacking of cellular machinery to replicate itself and release of new virus particles by exocytosis.  Antibodies binding to the spike protein can be expected to initiate destruction of the virus and may also prevent cell interaction and internalization.

# [PROJECT 2: Abnormal Sickle Cell Identification Using OpenCV](https://github.com/ManjWeerapura/python_projects/tree/main/OpenCV_Sickle_cell_identification)
OpenCV was used to process an image of a blood film to identify and mark the sickle cells. The process of identification involved image thresholding, finding
contours around all blood cells followed by using image moments to separate normal round blood cells from the abnormal sickle cells. It is hoped that sickle cell differentiation 
using OpenCV image moments can help in automating cell identification as well as determination of the severity of the anaemia.

# [PROJECT 3: Heart Failure Mortality Prediction](https://github.com/ManjWeerapura/python_projects/tree/main/Heart_Failure_Mortality_Prediction)
In this project, the goal is to be able to predict, using Machine Learning models, the survival outcome in patients with heart failure given the presence of various risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, smoking and anaemia as well as blood markers such as serum creatinine, serum sodium and creatinine phosphokinase.

# [PROJECT 4: Coronary Artery Disease Prediction](https://github.com/ManjWeerapura/python_projects/tree/main/Coronary_Artery_Disease_Prediction)
In this project, I explore the predictive capability of a Machine Learning model to correctly identify if a patient suffers from coronary artery disease (coronary artery narrowing) based on various non-invasive parameters such as ECG and exercise stress tests  as well as serum cholesterol and sugar levels.
