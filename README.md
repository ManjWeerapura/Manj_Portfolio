# PROJECT 1
Identify possible Covid-19 epitope candidates which can be used as a starting points for vaccine development. Using various related and unrelated peptides with specific features as well as their ability to evoke neutralizing antibody responses, I evaluated Machine Learning models’ ability in predicting the induction of anti- Covid-19 antibodies.  Surprisingly, many of these ‘candidates’ correspond to a small region of the spike protein of the virus. The spike protein is presumed to bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the host cell membrane. This binding initiates virus internalization and hijacking of cellular machinery to replicate itself and release of new virus particles by exocytosis.  Antibodies binding to the spike protein can be expected to initiate destruction of the virus and may also prevent cell interaction and internalization.
